# 🧰 Tech Stack Summary – Manish Prajapati

I specialize in backend system design and real-time transaction platforms using modern, scalable, and secure technologies.

---

## 🖥️ Languages & Core Skills

- **Java 11/17** – Primary language for microservices, concurrency, JVM optimization.
- **SQL** – Advanced knowledge of query optimization, joins, CTEs, indexing.
- **Bash** – Used in CI/CD scripts and server automation.

---

## 🧱 Frameworks & Libraries

- **Spring Boot** – Core framework for all microservices (REST, security, actuator, etc.)
- **Drools** – Rules engine for complex decisioning systems.
- **JUnit + Mockito** – Unit & integration testing for high-coverage CI pipelines.

---

## 🧠 System Design Concepts

- **Event-driven architecture** using Redis Streams / Kafka
- **High throughput design**: Multithreaded consumers, backpressure, sharding
- **Rule-based engines** for real-time fraud logic (Drools)
- **Scalable APIs**: Circuit breakers, timeouts, retries, and monitoring
- **Observability**: Logs, metrics, alerts via ELK, Prometheus, Micrometer

## 🗃️ Datastores

| Database       | Use Case / Notes                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PostgreSQL** | Primary datastore for transactional systems                               |
| **Redis**      | Used for both caching and real-time stream processing                     |
| **Kafka**      | Previously used for pub-sub and queue-based systems (not current project) |

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- **JWT-based authentication**
- **API Rate limiting**
- **RBI Guidelines**: Data retention, audit logs, traceability
- **Input sanitization and exception hardening**

---

## ⚙️ Tools & DevOps

- **Git, GitHub Actions, Jenkins** – CI/CD pipelines
- **Docker** – Local service orchestration & deployment
- **Postman & Swagger** – API design, testing, and documentation
- **JProfiler, JVisualVM** – JVM performance tuning when needed

---

## 🌍 Domains & Experience Areas

- ✅ Real-time fraud detection
- ✅ Payment gateway integration (UPI, cards, wallets)
- ✅ Transaction processing at scale (100K+ TPS)
- ✅ Risk scoring, blacklist handling, behavioral profiling
- ✅ Developer team mentorship and design ownership
